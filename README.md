# What the hell is going on with open source AI, language models, vision language models, and embeddings?

I built this app to track usage statistics across different AI models & providers, focusing specifically on:

- General-purpose language models

- Vision language models (VLMs)

- Embedding models

The live dashboard is at [cembalytics.vercel.app](https://cembalytics.vercel.app). I'm using data from [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co) and [Ollama](https://ollama.com).

Built with [FastHTML](https://fastht.ml/) to run the app from a python script.
